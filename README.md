EleNA - Elevation-based navigation system

# Problem Statement
Navigation systems optimize for the shortest or fastest route. However, they do not consider elevation gain. Letâ€™s say you are hiking or biking from one location to another. You may want to literally go the extra mile if that saves you a couple thousand feet in elevation gain. Likewise, you may want to maximize elevation gain if you are looking for an intense yet time-constrained workout.
The high-level goal of this project is to develop a software system that determines, given a start and an end location, a route that maximizes or minimizes elevation gain, while limiting the total distance between the two locations to x% of the shortest path.
