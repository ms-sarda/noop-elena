EleNA - Elevation-based navigation system

## Problem Statement

Navigation systems optimize for the shortest or fastest route. However, they do not consider elevation gain. Letâ€™s say you are hiking or biking from one location to another. You may want to literally go the extra mile if that saves you a couple thousand feet in elevation gain. Likewise, you may want to maximize elevation gain if you are looking for an intense yet time-constrained workout.
The high-level goal of this project is to develop a software system that determines, given a start and an end location, a route that maximizes or minimizes elevation gain, while limiting the total distance between the two locations to x% of the shortest path.

## Deploying the Service

### Deploying the Server
- Create a new virutal environment and install all dependencies using the following command:
``` pip install requirements.txt```
- In a new command line terminal run the following the command, from the project root:
 ```sh run_server.sh```
- This will block the terminal for port 8000


### Deploying the front end


## Testing the service

### Run Unit Tests
- We have used Pytest to implement unit testing functions
- In a new command line terminal run the following the command, from the project root:
`pytest`

### Testing the backend
- Deploy the backend using the commands above
- Using postman or command line, hit the following curl request

command line
` curl --location --request POST '0.0.0.0:8000/get_directions' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"source":"129 Brittany Manor Dr, Amherst, MA, US","destination":"136 Gray St, Amherst, MA, US","min_max":"max","deviation":"125","transport":"bike"}
`


- You should get a response similar to
json

## Shutting down

### Shutting down the Server
- Run the command `lsof -i TCP:8000`
- For each listed process, kill the process using the command `kill -9 <pid>`
